# Hafen Integration Guide

## Overview

This document explains how to properly integrate upstream hafen changes into nurgling2 while preserving nurgling's custom functionality.

## Critical Principle

**ALWAYS use git merge, NEVER cherry-pick or rebase hafen commits.**

### Why Merge?

- **Preserves git ancestry**: Future `git merge` commands will know which hafen commits are already integrated
- **Prevents duplicate commits**: Cherry-picking creates new commit SHAs, causing git to re-apply the same changes
- **Maintains history**: Shows the relationship between hafen and nurgling branches

### What Happens With Cherry-Picking (WRONG)

```bash
# DON'T DO THIS:
git cherry-pick <hafen-commits>
```

Result:
- Creates new commits with different SHAs
- Git doesn't know these are hafen commits
- Next integration will try to re-apply the same changes
- Merge conflicts on already-integrated code

## Integration Process

### Step 1: Prepare

```bash
# Ensure you're on master or create a new integration branch
git checkout master  # or: git checkout -b hafen-integration-YYYY-MM

# Fetch latest hafen changes
git fetch hafen
```

### Step 2: Check What's New

```bash
# See how many commits hafen is ahead
git log --oneline origin/master..hafen/master

# See what files changed (excluding resources)
git diff --stat origin/master hafen/master -- "*.java"

# Expected: ~20-30 commits, ~20-25 Java files for a typical integration
```

### Step 3: Merge (Not Cherry-Pick!)

```bash
# Merge hafen/master into your branch
git merge hafen/master

# This will likely cause merge conflicts in nurgling-customized files
```

### Step 4: Resolve Conflicts

The following files typically have conflicts:

#### Critical Files With Nurgling Customizations

**src/haven/Material.java**
- **Nurgling changes**: `Material.Res.get(int mask)` method, `HashMap<MaterialFactory.Status, Material> hm`
- **Resolution strategy**:
  - Keep hafen's `Buffer cons` field
  - Keep nurgling's `HashMap hm` field
  - Adapt `get(int mask)` to use hafen's new Buffer/Spec system
  - Example from working integration at commit 57d9570b2

**src/haven/Session.java**
- **Nurgling changes**:
  - `CachedRes` class made public (hafen made it private)
  - `injectMessage()` method for multi-session support
  - `res_id_cache` map and `getResName()` method
- **Resolution strategy**:
  - Accept hafen's changes but restore nurgling extensions
  - Make `CachedRes` and `Ref` public again
  - Add back `injectMessage()` method
  - Add back `res_id_cache` functionality
  - Example at commit 51a5a5f4e

**src/haven/QuestWnd.java**
- **⚠ This entry used to say "usually minimal, take --theirs". That is no longer
  true and following it will silently break the quest tracker.**
- **Nurgling changes**: `$_` factory returns `nurgling.NQuestWnd`;
  `Quest.DefaultBox` → `nurgling.NQuestBox`; `NUtils.setQuestConds` hook in
  `Quest.Info.uimsg("conds")`; `NUtils.addQuest`/`removeQuest` hooks in the
  `uimsg("quests")` loop; ctor split into an overridable `buildLayout()`
  (so `questbox`/`cqst`/`dqst` are non-final); an extra
  `QuestList(Coord, int itemh, boolean showcond)` ctor for NQuestWnd's row height.
- **Resolution strategy**: Take hafen's version of any rewritten method, then
  re-graft the hooks above onto the new control flow. See the Aug 2026 round 2
  notes for a worked example.

**src/haven/TexRender.java**
- **Nurgling changes**: Usually minimal
- **Resolution strategy**: Take hafen's version (--theirs)

### Step 5: Add Nurgling Customizations

After resolving conflicts, ensure these nurgling-specific files are included:

**Critical Customizations:**

1. **src/haven/ModSprite.java**
   - Purpose: Container status color system
   - Changes: customMask forcing logic for dframes/barrels
   - Lines: ~25 lines added in `Meshes.operate()` method

2. **src/haven/StaticSprite.java**
   - Purpose: Container status color system
   - Changes: customMask forcing logic for barrels/dframes
   - Lines: ~30 lines added in `lsparts()` method

3. **src/nurgling/NGob.java**
   - Purpose: Core nurgling game object extensions
   - No hafen conflicts (purely nurgling code)

4. **src/nurgling/tools/MaterialFactory.java**
   - Purpose: Provides custom materials for container status colors
   - No hafen conflicts (purely nurgling code)

### Step 6: Build and Test

```bash
# Force a FULL recompile. Incremental javac misses subclass/override breakage
# introduced by a merge, so never trust an incremental build here.
#
# Do NOT use `ant clean`: it wipes lib/ext, and the re-downloaded lwjgl-fat
# crashes the client at startup. Delete the class output instead:
rm -rf build/classes
powershell.exe -Command "cd C:\\Users\\imbecil\\nurgling2; ant"

# Common compilation errors after hafen integration:
# - Session.CachedRes access issues → ensure CachedRes is public
# - Material.Res changes → check get(int mask) method
# - Missing imports → hafen may have reorganized packages
```

### Step 7: Commit the Merge

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Merge hafen/master - integrate upstream changes

- Merged X commits from hafen/master
- Resolved conflicts in Material.java, Session.java, etc.
- Preserved nurgling's MaterialFactory integration
- Preserved container status color system
- Updated to hafen's new [describe major change, e.g., PType system]"
```

### Step 8: Verify History

```bash
# Verify hafen commits are in ancestry
git log --oneline --graph --decorate -20

# Should show merge commit with two parents:
# * <hash> (HEAD) Merge hafen/master
# |\
# | * <hash> (hafen/master) <hafen commit>
# | * <hash> <hafen commit>
# * | <hash> <nurgling commit>

# Test that hafen commits are ancestors
git merge-base --is-ancestor <hafen-commit-sha> HEAD
# Should exit with code 0 (success)
```

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ WRONG: Cherry-picking hafen commits

```bash
git cherry-pick <hafen-commit>  # DON'T DO THIS
```

**Problem**: Creates duplicate commits, breaks future integrations

### ❌ WRONG: Using --theirs for all conflicts

```bash
git merge hafen/master
git checkout --theirs .  # DON'T DO THIS
git commit
```

**Problem**: Loses all nurgling customizations

### ❌ WRONG: Forgetting to verify ancestry

```bash
git merge hafen/master
# resolve conflicts
git commit
# DONE! ...but is hafen actually in the ancestry?
```

**Problem**: May have accidentally created orphan commits

### ✅ CORRECT: Selective conflict resolution

```bash
git merge hafen/master
# Material.java: carefully merge nurgling + hafen
# Session.java: restore nurgling extensions on top of hafen
# QuestWnd.java: take hafen's version
git commit
# Verify ancestry with: git merge-base --is-ancestor <hafen-commit> HEAD
```

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Take Hafen + Add Nurgling (Material.java)

```bash
# 1. Accept hafen's new architecture
git show hafen/master:src/haven/Material.java > src/haven/Material.java

# 2. Add nurgling's get(int mask) method
# Edit Material.java to add:
#   - private transient HashMap<MaterialFactory.Status, Material> hm
#   - public Material get(int mask) { ... }

# 3. Import MaterialFactory
# Add: import nurgling.tools.MaterialFactory;
```

### Strategy 2: Take Hafen + Restore Extensions (Session.java)

```bash
# 1. Accept most of hafen's changes
git checkout --theirs src/haven/Session.java

# 2. Manually restore nurgling extensions:
#   - Change "private static class CachedRes" → "public static class CachedRes"
#   - Add injectMessage() method
#   - Add res_id_cache field and getResName() method
```

### Strategy 3: Take Hafen Completely (QuestWnd.java)

```bash
# Simple case: no nurgling customizations needed
git checkout --theirs src/haven/QuestWnd.java
```

## Verification Checklist

After integration, verify:

- [ ] Build succeeds: `ant clean compile`
- [ ] Hafen commits in ancestry: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <hafen-commit> HEAD` → exit 0
- [ ] Container colors work: barrels/dframes/ttubs show correct status colors
- [ ] MaterialFactory integration intact: `grep -r "MaterialFactory" src/haven/Material.java`
- [ ] Session extensions present: `grep -r "injectMessage\|CachedRes" src/haven/Session.java`
- [ ] NGob field exists: `grep "public NGob ngob" src/haven/Gob.java`
- [ ] No duplicate hafen commits: `git log --oneline --all | grep "Add PType utility" | wc -l` → should be 1

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check hafen commits not yet integrated
git log --oneline origin/master..hafen/master

# See file changes (Java only)
git diff --stat origin/master hafen/master -- "*.java"

# Merge hafen
git merge hafen/master

# During conflicts - see what each side changed
git diff HEAD:src/haven/Material.java hafen/master:src/haven/Material.java

# Take hafen's version of a file
git checkout --theirs src/haven/QuestWnd.java

# Take nurgling's version of a file
git checkout --ours src/haven/Material.java

# Verify ancestry after merge
git merge-base --is-ancestor $(git rev-parse hafen/master) HEAD && echo "✓ Ancestry verified"

# See merge commit structure
git log --oneline --graph --decorate -20
```

```

## Future Integrations

For the next hafen integration:

1. Follow this guide exactly
2. Use `git merge hafen/master` (not cherry-pick!)
3. Resolve conflicts using the strategies above
4. Build and test thoroughly
5. Verify ancestry with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
6. Update this document if new patterns emerge

### May 2026 integration notes (37 commits)

- **Conflicts (3, the rest auto-merged):**
  - `Makewindow.java` — took hafen's rewrite, re-added the `NMakewindow` factory override + import.
  - `WItem.java` — took hafen's reusable `GItem.RStateInfo.combine` (nurgling side was the old inline copy).
  - `GLPanel.java` — adopted hafen's `import haven.GSettings.SyncMode` (enum moved from `JOGLPanel`), kept nurgling imports.
- **Compile fix after merge:** hafen converted cameras to fine-scrolling, changing
  `Camera.wheel(Coord, int)` → `wheel(MouseWheelEvent)` (uses `ev.s`). Updated nurgling's
  custom cameras `NOrthoCam` and `RSTCam` in `MapView.java`. (`mmousewheel(Coord, int)` is a
  separate, unchanged interface — left alone.)
- **MiniMap redisplay moved into `tick()`** (with `DisplayMarker.dispupdate()`); `NMiniMap`
  still works because its `tick()` calls `super.tick()` and it computes marker positions itself.
- **Make-window feature port (NMakewindow):** ported hafen's two new features into nurgling's
  reimplementation — server `use` msg (in-use red overlay on inputs) and `inprcps` msg +
  `choose`/`findrcps` clicks (input recipe-choice popup). Split cleanly: autoMode = nurgling
  automation, normal mode = hafen input-choice.
- **Verified safe (no nurgling refs):** GSettings `SyncMode` move, profiling-switch removal,
  `SListBox` fine-scroll (internal `cury` int→double, public API unchanged).

### June 2026 integration notes (159 commits — the "iosys" rewrite) — MAJOR

This was hafen's `iosys` branch: a ground-up rewrite of the client I/O layer. Far
larger than a normal integration. Full port design + recovery info:
`docs/hafen-integration-2026-06-port-design.md`. Merge commit `9852d1b92`.

- **Architecture change:** `MainFrame`(AWT Frame) + `UIPanel`/`GLPanel`/`JOGLPanel`/
  `LWJGLPanel` + `UI.Context` were **deleted**, replaced by `Client` +
  `haven.iosys.tk.Toolkit`/`Windeye` + abstract `UILoop`. `MainFrame` is now a
  6-line `Client.main()` shim upstream. Panama FFI lives in `opt/panama` (compiled
  only on JDK ≥ 22 via `has-panama`); the main client still builds on the current JDK.
- **Conflicts (11):** README, build.xml (kept nurgling Main-Class=MainFrame + extra
  jars, added hafen-panama.jar + Add-Exports/Enable-Native-Access), Utils
  (kept public `imgsz` + hafen `initlocale`), GobIcon (imports), UI
  (`UI.Context`→added `UILoop loop` back-ref; kept get/setInstance; took hafen
  CommandQueue.drain), OptWnd (took hafen ui-param panels + audio API, re-grafted
  L10n + nqolwnd), MainFrame, and modify/delete on the 4 panel classes.
- **The real work (git couldn't flag it — classes vanished):** nurgling's
  multi-session + headless subsystems were built on the deleted classes.
  - Added to `UILoop`: a `mkui()` factory (so every loop builds `NUI` not `UI`), a
    `UI.loop` back-reference, and the multi-session lifecycle hooks
    (`beforeNewUI`/`afterNewUI`) that formerly lived on `GLPanel.Loop.newui()`.
  - `MainFrame` rebuilt as a pure nurgling **launcher** (config/l10n/logging/error-
    handling/headless-dispatch/NBootstrap factory) delegating windowing to `Client`.
    Kept `MainFrame.config` (NConfig) + `setupres()`→`Client.setupres()` so NCore /
    HeadlessMain were untouched. Edited the merged `Client.java` in place
    (Option A): `ClientLoop.mkui()`→`NUI`, `Client.Main`→`NBootstrap.create()`.
  - Multi-session (`NRemoteUI`/`NUILifecycleListener`/`SessionUIController`/
    `UILifecycleListener`): retargeted `UIPanel`/`GLPanel`/`ui.getContext()` →
    `UILoop`/`ui.getLoop()`/`loop.env`.
  - **Headless rebuilt on hafen infra:** new `NHeadlessLoop extends UILoop` backed by
    `DummyToolkit.DummyWindow.of(size, new HeadlessEnvironment(), null)`. Kept the
    GL-free `HeadlessEnvironment`/`HeadlessRender`/… stub (no GPU/Acephal needed —
    headless never used real GL). Deleted `HeadlessPanel`; `HeadlessMain` drives the
    loop via `task.run(loop.newui(task))` (UI ctor calls `fun.init`).
- **Compile-fix ripples after merge (caught by `ant clean`, not incremental):**
  - Audio rewrite removed static `Audio.play`/`Audio.volume` → `ui.sfx(...)` /
    `ui.audio.sys.volume()` (NAlarmManager routes through `UI.getInstance()`).
  - `WebBrowser` deleted → `ui.wnd.toolkit().browse(URI)` (NMappingClient, NLoginScreen).
- **Deferred (recorded, not lost):** LWJGLPanel's GL-cleanup hardening (shutdown
  hook / swapBuffers guard / env-dispose). LWJGL-backend only; JOGL is default.
- **Status:** `ant clean` builds; ancestry verified. Runtime testing (visual login,
  multi-session switch/demote, headless `-bots`) still pending at time of writing.

### June 2026 round 2 (49 commits — make-window v31 + MenuSearch refactor)

Normal-size integration on top of the iosys merge (merge-base `e16dcf24b` →
hafen/master `dcb2e1b70`). Merge commit `f924bf54d`, branch
`hafen-integration-2026-06b`. Only **3 git conflicts** — but the real risk was a
nurgling-only file that auto-merged clean yet would break at runtime.

- **⚠ Hidden runtime break — NMakewindow (no git conflict).** Hafen bumped
  `Session.PVER` 30 → 31 and rewrote the make-window `inpop`/`opop` wire format
  (modular: each spec wrapped in an `OBJS` array; indexed updates when first arg is
  an INT; new `constraint` sub-arg; `Spec` ctor → `ResData`). Nurgling's
  `NMakewindow` is a parallel reimplementation (`extends Widget`, its own `Spec`,
  its own flat-format parser) — git/ant can't flag it, but the v31 server would
  send the new format and crafting/autocraft/presets would misparse. **Ported**
  `parsespec()` + dual-form `inpop`/`opop` + `constraint` field; added
  `ui.modflags()` to the `choose` send. Category detection is name-based
  (`VSpec.categories.get(s.name)`), unaffected by the constraint change.
- **Conflicts (3):**
  - `MenuSearch.java` — hafen made it `abstract` (base + `Main` subclass + abstract
    `generate()` + `recons`/`tvisible()`/`pagseq` + `reqclose();settext();refilter()`
    in `activate`). Re-grafted nurgling features onto the new shape: `Result.bot`,
    `Fuzzy.fuzzyFilterAndSort` in `refilter()`, drag-drop+grab+`draw()`+`tooltip()`
    in `Results`, bots from `BotRegistry.allowedInBotMenu()` in base `updlist()`,
    and global-paginae accumulation moved into `Main.generate()` (uses `menu.pagseq`
    to retrigger; nurgling search stays global, ignoring the current category root).
  - `GameUI.java` — hafen replaced `wdgmsg("close")` listening with per-window
    `reqclose(Runnable)` callbacks and made the search window always-present
    (`MenuSearch.Main` created at `place=="menu"`). The old close-router `wdgmsg`
    override auto-merged away; csearch button auto-merged to the toggle form. Kept
    nurgling's `NMapWnd`/`NMenuGridWdg`/`NMiniMapWnd` and the intentionally
    commented-out `MapMenu` buttons; added the always-present srchwnd alongside the
    nurgling menu-grid widget; added the map-window `reqclose` callback to `NMapWnd`.
  - `MainFrame.java` — modify/delete: hafen deleted its own 7-line compatibility
    shim (`092e98b92`); nurgling's MainFrame is our launcher → kept ours.
- **Auto-merged, verified intact:** Makewindow (3-line nurgling delta), Window
  (`reqclose(Runnable)` setter), GobIcon, Audio/JavaSound/DummyAudio (NAlarmManager
  already uses `ui.sfx()`), Session (injectMessage/CachedRes), Material
  (MaterialFactory), container-color customMask. All `opt/panama/**` additions
  (DBus/desktop-portal/OSX/ALSA FFI) are JDK ≥ 22-only and don't touch the main build.
- **Status:** `ant clean` builds; ancestry verified (`f924bf54d` two-parent merge,
  hafen tip `dcb2e1b70` is an ancestor of HEAD). **Runtime testing pending** —
  especially crafting/autocraft/craft-presets (NMakewindow v31 port), action search
  incl. bot drag-drop, window close behavior, and audio/alarms. Not pushed.

### July 2026 integration (31 commits — "rekey" + new authd protocol) — SMALL

Merge-base `dcb2e1b70` → hafen/master `592d4d5ac`. Merge commit `fecdd698c`, branch
`hafen-integration-2026-07` (branched off **origin/master**, which was ahead of local
master). Only **1 conflict**, and — unlike the last two rounds — **no hidden runtime
break**: `Session.PVER` stayed at 31, so no wire format changed under a nurgling
reimplementation.

- **Theme 1 — "rekey" (physical keys vs. key symbols).** `Key.Std` is no longer a
  `Key`; it now implements a new nested `Key.Sym`. `Key` loses `nm()` and gains
  `primary()` / `primary(Collection)` / `is(Sym)`; `KeyDownEvent` gains `sym()`.
  Std constants gained `char ch` values and the list constants were renamed
  (`NUMKEYS`→`NUMBERS`, `NUMPADKEYS`→`PADNUMBERS`, `ALPHAKEYS`→`LATIN`, plus `ALL`).
  **Zero nurgling impact** — every nurgling keybind site (`NMapView`, `SessionTabBar`,
  `NToolBeltProp`, `QuickActionPreset`, `NGameUI`) uses the AWT-era API
  (`KeyMatch.forcode`, `java.awt.event.KeyEvent`, `ev.code`, `ev.awt`), which the
  compat layer still exposes. Nothing in `src/nurgling` references `haven.iosys.tk.Key`.
  ⚠ Note for future: the `Key.Std` id prefix changed `"std."` → `"std:"`. That is a
  *persisted* id — hafen-side keybinds stored under old ids won't resolve. Harmless
  today because nurgling doesn't persist those ids, but don't build on `Key.Std.id()`.
- **Theme 2 — new authd protocol.** `AuthClient.cmd()`/`esendmsg()` changed from a
  positional arg list to a command name plus keyword pairs (sends `cmd + "*"`;
  `TokenInfo.encode()` returns a `Map` instead of `Object[]`).
  `Credentials.name()` → `authname()`, and **`tryauth()` now returns `Session.User`
  instead of `String`** (it also canonicalizes: `authname` is updated to the account
  name the server returns). `Bootstrap.settoken` now no-ops on a null user and writes
  `null` rather than `""` to clear a pref.
- **Conflict (1): `Bootstrap.java`.** Nurgling owns this file (factory +
  `setFactory`/`create`, `preRun`/`createRemoteUI` hooks, and the `authmech` switch
  that picks `NLoginScreen` for "native"). Hafen rewrote the auth flow inside `run()`.
  The conflict was only the adjacent login-widget + `loginname` lines: **kept
  nurgling's `authmech` switch, took hafen's `String loginname = null`** — hafen now
  derives it from `creds.authname()` after auth and only persists it when non-null.
  Everything else in `run()` auto-merged; `createRemoteUI(sess)` at the tail survived.
- **Compile fix (1):** `nurgling/headless/SimpleAuthClient` assigned `tryauth()` to a
  `String` → now takes `Session.User` and reads `.name`. This was the *only* fallout,
  and javac caught it because the signature changed (contrast with June's NMakewindow
  wire-format break, which nothing could catch statically).
- **Auto-merged, verified intact:** `AuthClient` (nurgling's `alwaysObfuscate`
  connect logic — hafen's edits were in `esendmsg`/`Credentials`, well away from the
  ctor), `Client` (`mkui()`→`NUI`, `NBootstrap.create()`, Nurgling II window titles),
  `HashDirCache` (public `base`), `Widget` (nurgling hunks at lines ~45/65/702/2018 vs
  hafen's `key_tab.match(ev.awt, KeyMatch.S)` at ~1358 — no overlap).
- **Checked and clear:** `NBootstrap` is the only nurgling subclass of a rewritten
  hafen class, and it only overrides the two nurgling-added hooks (it does *not*
  duplicate `run()`, so the auth-flow rewrite flows through automatically).
  `NLoginScreen` keeps its own token store (`saveLoginToken`), independent of
  `Bootstrap`'s `savedtoken-*` prefs, so `settoken`'s null-vs-empty change can't
  corrupt it. No nurgling toolkit subclasses, so the large `AWTToolkit` /
  `NEWTContext` / `opt/panama` GLX-WGL diffs are inert.
- **Status:** `ant clean` + full build succeeds (5336 classes, jar built); ancestry
  verified (`fecdd698c` two-parent, hafen tip `592d4d5ac` is an ancestor).
  **Runtime testing pending** — login is the area to exercise: native login via
  `NLoginScreen`, saved-token login, headless `-bots` auth, and multi-session
  switch/demote (which re-enters `NBootstrap.preRun`). Not pushed.

### July 2026 round 2 (26 commits — multi-polity / Kith & Kin) — SMALL

Merge-base `592d4d5ac` → hafen/master `9bba2bb9d`. Merge commit `57b811005`, branch
`hafen-integration-2026-07-polity`. **4 conflicts**, all small.

**Why this one was found from a symptom, not from `git log`.** The Village tab in
Kith & Kin showed `"Please update your client!"` and had lost its village dropdown.
That string is in *neither* client — it lives in the **server-distributed resource
code** `ui/vlg`, whose constructor probes the client and degrades gracefully:

```java
Widget prev = add(new AuthMeter(new Coord(width, UI.scale(20))), Coord.z);
try {
    new Member(new Member(0));            // needs Polity.Member(Member)
} catch(LinkageError e) {
    prev = add(new Label("Please update your client!", nmf), prev.pos("bl").adds(0, 15));
```

`Polity.Member(Member)` arrived in hafen `44b7c8eab`, which we hadn't merged, so the
probe threw `NoSuchMethodError` and the fallback label rendered.

> **Diagnostic technique worth reusing.** When a server-side resource widget
> misbehaves and the string isn't in our source, dump it from the client's res cache.
> `HashDirCache` writes the resource name into each file's header as **plain**
> modified-UTF-8, so the name greps even though the body doesn't:
> ```bash

- **Theme — multiple polities of the same type.** `Polity` is now **abstract** with
  `public abstract String type()` (the concrete subclasses live in resource code:
  `ui/vlg` returns `"pol"`, `ui/realm` returns `"rlm"`). `Zergwnd` no longer hardcodes
  two tab buttons; `Zergwnd.Category` holds a `List<Polity>` per type and renders a
  plain `Label` when you're in one, a `Category.Selector extends SDropBox<Polity, Widget>`
  when you're in several. Tab buttons are created on demand from the type string
  (`gfx/hud/buttons/<type>`), sorted by the up-image's `z`, and the Category caption
  comes from that resource's tooltip layer. `GameUI.polities` and `Zergwnd.dtab()` are
  gone — destruction is handled by `Category.cdestroy` / `PTab.cdestroy`.
  `Polity.Member` also gained `rname()`/`name()`/`order` and a copy ctor, `memb`
  became a `Map` guarded by `mseq`, and `parsememb` takes the previous member.
- **⚠ The real work — `NZergwnd` (no git conflict).** Nurgling replaced
  `GameUI.Zergwnd` with a **fork**, `src/nurgling/widgets/NZergwnd.java` (`GameUI.zerg`
  is an `NZergwnd`; `GameUI.Zergwnd` is dead code kept only so upstream diffs apply
  cleanly). Git merged upstream's rewrite into the dead class and left the fork
  untouched — it still had `pol`/`pol2`/`dtab` and dispatched on `p.cap`. **Rewritten**
  against the new `Category`/`PTab`/`TButton` shape, keeping the two nurgling deltas:
  `L10n.get("opt.keybind.kith_kin")` window title and `L10n.get("kin.window_title")`
  Kin tooltip. From `nurgling.widgets` the only source change needed vs. upstream is
  `TextItem` → `SListWidget.TextItem`. **If you ever touch `GameUI.Zergwnd`, mirror it
  into `NZergwnd` — nothing enforces this and javac won't notice.**
- **Conflicts (4):**
  - `Polity.java` — took hafen's `rname()`/`name()` refactor of `Member.draw`, kept
    nurgling's `UI.scale(5, 10)` name offset (upstream uses 0). `unk = "?Unknown?"`
    auto-merged. Note `ui/vlg`'s `VMember.draw` overrides this anyway; the offset only
    shows for generic polities.
  - `BuddyWnd.java` — hafen moved `Text rname` down next to `rname()` and made it
    private. Kept nurgling's `atime`/`lastOnline`/`upTime` and **deleted** the local
    `Text rname` field, else it'd shadow-duplicate the relocated one.
  - `MenuSearch.java` — hafen changed `Main.tick(double)` → `tick(TickEvent)` /
    `ev.visible` in the same hunk where nurgling had removed `root`/`setroot()` (June
    round 2's global-search change). Kept nurgling's shape, took hafen's signature.
  - `GameUI.java` — field block only: kept nurgling's widget fields and
    `public final NZergwnd zerg`, dropped `polities` as upstream did. The `addchild`
    `place=="pol"` branch and the `cdestroy` polity branch auto-merged to upstream's.
- **Auto-merged, verified intact:** `Widget` (`TickEvent.visible` + `dispatch`
  override), `Composited`, `Debug`, `LoginScreen`, `MapMesh`, all of `iosys/**`
  (new `Providers` discovery for toolkits/audio; nurgling has no toolkit subclasses),
  `render/**` GL debug-message plumbing, `opt/panama/**` (JDK ≥ 22 only).
- **No `Session.PVER` change**, so no nurgling wire-format reimplementation is at
  risk this round (contrast June's `NMakewindow`).
- **Status:** `ant clean` + full build succeeds; ancestry verified
  (`git merge-base --is-ancestor hafen/master HEAD` → 0). **Runtime testing pending** —
  open Kith & Kin and confirm the Village tab renders the panel (not the update
  message), that the name shows as a label with one village and a dropdown with two
  or more, that switching villages swaps the panel, and that the Realm tab still
  works. Not pushed.

### August 2026 integration (32 commits — DPI/monitors, indirect toolkit, console) — SMALL

Merge-base `9bba2bb9d` → hafen/master `f4b86b855`. Merge commit `800f98930`, branch
`hafen-integration-2026-08` (off master; origin/master and master were level).
Only **2 conflicts**. No `Session.PVER` change (still 31), so no nurgling
wire-format reimplementation was at risk this round.

**This one was driven by a symptom: the Kith & Kin Village tab showed only "Banish".**
Same family of bug as July's "Please update your client!" — the visible widget is
server-distributed resource code, not ours. `ui/vlg` (`Village`) keeps its three
action buttons ("Leave the Village", "Oath of Allegiance", "Revoke the Privilege")
in a container `actcnt` that it **hides whenever a member widget is attached**:

```java
public void addchild(Widget child, Object... args) {   // res/ui/vlg
    if(p.equals("m")) { mw = child; add(child, 0, my); actcnt.hide(); pack(); return; }
public void cdestroy(Widget w) {
    if(w == mw) actcnt.show();
```

"Banish" lives in the *other* resource, `ui/vmemb` (`VillageMember`), which is that
member widget. So "only Banish" means *a member is selected and cannot be
deselected* — the client had no way to send a bare `sel` with no id, because
`SListWidget.ItemWidget.mousedown` unconditionally did `list.change(item)`. One
click on a villager hid the actions panel for the rest of the login session.

Fixed upstream by exactly two of the merged commits:
- `0585af16b` — `ItemWidget` gains overridable `clicked(MouseDownEvent)` + `toggle()`,
  and `mousedown` now only acts on `ev.b == 1` (other buttons propagate).
- `900478c23` — `Polity.MemberList.makeitem` overrides `clicked()` to send
  `list.change(null)` (→ `wdgmsg("sel")`) when you click the already-selected member.

⚠ Nothing in *our* source ever mentioned those three button labels — grepping `src/`
finds nothing. Reuse July's technique: dump the resource out of the client's disk
cache (`grep -rla "res/ui/vlg" "$APPDATA/Haven and Hearth/data"`, then `strings`) to
read the server-side widget's real logic before assuming a nurgling regression.

- **Conflicts (2):**
  - `UI.java` — hafen deleted `private static final double scalef` (scaling is now
    lazily initialized through a `scalef()` accessor + `static { }` block removal, so
    `Toolkit.instance()` isn't forced early). The conflict was only that nurgling's
    `gui`/`core` fields sit in the same field block. Kept `gui`/`core`, dropped `scalef`.
  - `GameUI.java` — hafen converted every `Console.Command` anonymous class to a
    lambda. Took hafen's lambda form; kept nurgling's deletion of the `belt` command
    (nurgling swaps in its own belt widget and has no `beltwdg` field). Note hafen
    now writes `GameUI.this.chrid` — required, since a lambda's `this` differs.
- **Auto-merged, verified by hand:**
  - `ModSprite` — hafen split `Poser` into `Poser`(order −1000) + `Poser.Applier`
    (order 1010) and moved `RenderLinks` from order 2000 to 0. Nurgling's two deltas
    (customMask forcing in `Meshes.operate()`, `NurglingVarMatOverride` registered in
    `$res.operate()`) are in untouched regions and survived. **Ordering still holds:**
    `VarMats`(100) → `NurglingVarMatOverride`(150), and `Meshes` was always order 0,
    so container status colors are unaffected. RenderLinks dropping to 0 only means
    its parts are now also visible to the 150-order override — harmless.
  - `Console` — `public Map findcmds()` on `Console`/`UI.ConsoleHost` was **removed**
    in favour of a short-circuiting `findcmd(String)`. Nurgling only implements
    `Console.Directory.findcmds()` (`NCornerMiniMap`), which is unchanged. The
    `Utils` static block of debug commands moved into `Console` itself.
  - `SListWidget.ItemWidget.mousedown` now returns `false` for non-left buttons
    instead of swallowing them. Audited nurgling's ~20 `ItemWidget` subclasses that
    override `mousedown`: all either gate on `ev.b == 1` or just delegate.
  - `UILoop.basestate()` now preps `wnd.fbstate()` instead of a hardcoded
    `FragColor`+`DepthBuffer`. `DummyToolkit.DummyWindow.of()` returns `Pipe.Op.nil`,
    so nurgling's `NHeadlessLoop` now starts from an empty pipe. Headless never drove
    real GL (`HeadlessEnvironment` is a stub), so this should be inert — but it is the
    one behavioural change worth watching if headless bots misbehave.
  - `Client` (`window` console command, `tk.sharedenvs()`), `Providers.findfirst`,
    `MapView`/`MapWnd`/`RootWidget`/`Audio`/`Config`/`HeadlessClient` (lambda
    conversion only), `build.xml` (hafen dropped the steamworks fileset from the
    `jars` target; nurgling's own `bin` target keeps its copy).
- **Not touched upstream this round:** `GameUI.Zergwnd` (so `NZergwnd` needed no
  mirroring), `Makewindow`, `MenuSearch`, `Session`, `Material`, `Bootstrap`.
- **⚠ Expect a visible UI-scale change.** `UI.loadscale()` now prefers
  `Monitor.scaling()`, then `userdpi()/96`, then `density()/100`, replacing the old
  `rint(density/5)*0.05` heuristic; `f4b86b855` also fixes how the Win32 scaling
  factor is read. If the client comes up at a different size, that is upstream
  intent, not a merge error — `Config`'s `uiscale` pref still overrides it.
- **Build note (separate commit `2ebadb16b`, not part of the merge):** the nurgling
  `extlib/jogl-arm` target unconditionally `<get>`s four version-pinned jogamp.org
  URLs, so every `ant bin` needs jogamp.org reachable. It was not reachable from the
  Windows JDK here (TLS "Connection reset"), which failed the build *after* a
  successful compile. Added `skipexisting="true"` — the URLs pin an exact version, so
  a present file is already the right one, and `ant clean` still forces a refetch.
- **Status:** `ant clean`-equivalent full rebuild succeeds (5402 classes, `bin/hafen.jar`
  built); ancestry verified (`git merge-base --is-ancestor hafen/master HEAD` → 0).
  **Runtime testing pending** — primarily: open Kith & Kin → Village, click a member
  (panel shows name/group/Banish), click the same member again to deselect, and
  confirm "Actions:" plus the three buttons come back. Also worth a look: UI scaling
  on startup, and any list-widget right-click behaviour. Not pushed.

### August 2026 round 2 (57 commits — new quest format / PVER 32, OSX toolkit) — SMALL

Merge-base `f4b86b855` → hafen/master `bbfc4d728`. Merge commit `372bac1d0`, branch
`hafen-integration-2026-08b` (off master; origin/master and master were level).
Only **1 conflict** — but `Session.PVER` went **31 → 32**, so this round belongs to
the June-`NMakewindow` family: a wire format changed under us.

**Read the PVER line first.** 57 commits sounds large, but `git diff --stat` over
`src/*.java` showed only **6 files**; the other ~4,000 lines are `opt/panama/**`
(OSX Cocoa toolkit, Xkb key aliases, a Panama replacement for steamworks4j), which
compiles only on JDK ≥ 22 and is inert for the main build. The whole risk surface
of a round can be this small even when the commit count is not — and conversely,
`PVER` moving means *something* reparses, so find what before trusting the size.

- **Theme 1 — new quest wire format (the PVER bump).** The `quests` uimsg changed
  from a flat, self-delimiting arg list to **one `OBJS` array per quest**, and each
  quest gained two trailing ints `ncond` / `ndcond` (done/total conditions).
  Deletion is now signalled by a payload holding *only* the id (`qd.length == a`)
  rather than by a null resource. `Quest`'s ctor collapsed to `Quest(int id)` with
  fields assigned afterwards. Pending-quest rows can now show an `n/m` counter.
- **Conflict (1): `QuestWnd.java`.** Nurgling does **not** fork QuestWnd — it
  subclasses (`NQuestWnd extends QuestWnd`) but *does* patch `haven/QuestWnd.java`
  in place with quest-tracker hooks. Hafen rewrote the whole `uimsg` loop those
  hooks lived in. Took hafen's loop wholesale and re-grafted all three hooks onto
  the new control flow:
  - `NUtils.removeQuest` → the new id-only removal branch (was: the `res == null` else-branch).
  - `NUtils.addQuest` → inside `if(nl != cl)` when `nl != dqst` (unchanged shape).
  - `NUtils.removeQuest` → next to `q.done(...)`, now guarded by hafen's
    `(cl == cqst) && (nl == dqst)` instead of the old explicit PEND/DISABLED
    state comparison. Same event, hafen just expresses it as a list transition.
  The `setQuestConds` hook in `Quest.Info.uimsg("conds")` and the `NQuestBox` /
  `NQuestWnd` factory swaps are in untouched regions and auto-merged.
- **⚠ Silent break git could not flag — `QuestList.showcond`.** Hafen added
  `public final boolean showcond` to `QuestList`, assigned only in its own
  `QuestList(Coord, boolean)` ctor. Nurgling had added a *second* ctor,
  `QuestList(Coord sz, int itemh)` (NQuestWnd needs a custom row height), which
  now left a blank final unassigned. javac *did* catch this one — but only
  because the field is final; had it been a plain field, nurgling's quest log
  would have silently rendered `showcond == false` and quietly lost the new
  feature. Threaded the flag through as `QuestList(Coord, int itemh, boolean
  showcond)` and passed `true` from `NQuestWnd`'s current list / `false` from its
  completed list, matching upstream's intent.
  **Generalisable rule:** when upstream adds a field to a class nurgling has added
  an overload/ctor to, check every nurgling ctor, not just the conflicted hunk.
- **Theme 2 — physical keys (`Key.Loc`).** `Key` gained an **abstract**
  `location()` plus a nested `Key.Loc` interface with an Xkb-style `Std` scancode
  enum (`AD01`, `KPEN`, …, ids `"std:NAME"`). An abstract method added to a
  widely-implemented interface is normally a compile break; here it is inert
  because **every implementor is hafen-owned** and was updated in the same round:
  `AWTToolkit.AWTKey`, `NEWTContext.NEWTKey`, and the panama `WGLContext.W32Key` /
  `GLXContext.X11Key`. Verified `src/nurgling` neither implements nor references
  `haven.iosys.tk.Key` (still true since July's rekey round). Nurgling's keybind
  sites remain on the AWT-era compat API.
- **Auto-merged, verified by hand:**
  - `Client` — now sets `ui.lastevent = Utils.rtime()` on key events. Nurgling
    writes `ui.lastevent` too, in `SessionContext`'s background tick loop, to keep
    *demoted* sessions from being treated as idle. Different code paths
    (foreground input vs. background tick), complementary, no interference.
  - `Session` — PVER only; `injectMessage` / public `CachedRes` untouched.
  - `AWTToolkit` / `NEWTContext` — additive `Key.Loc` plumbing only.
- **Not touched upstream this round:** `Makewindow`/`NMakewindow`, `MenuSearch`,
  `GameUI`, `GameUI.Zergwnd` (so `NZergwnd` needed no mirroring), `Material`,
  `Bootstrap`, `ModSprite`/`StaticSprite`, `Polity`.
- **Noted, not done (out of scope):** `QuestModel.pumpConds` sweeps `qsel` per quest
  to harvest objective *text*, so the new `ncond`/`ndcond` counts do **not** replace
  it. They could cheaply short-circuit the "is this quest's progress stale?" check,
  since `ndcond` now arrives unsolicited with every quest update. Possible future
  optimisation of the tracker's selection-stealing sweep.
- **Status:** full rebuild succeeds (5528 classes, `bin/hafen.jar` built); ancestry
  verified (`git merge-base --is-ancestor bbfc4d728 HEAD` → 0; `372bac1d0` is a
  two-parent merge). **Runtime testing pending** — the quest path is what to
  exercise, since the wire format moved: open the Quest Log and confirm current
  quests list with an `n/m` counter on the right and completed quests without one;
  accept a new quest (appears in Current, tracker panel picks it up); complete one
  (moves to Completed, leaves the tracker); abandon/lose one (disappears from both).
  Then confirm the nurgling quest tracker panel still shows objectives, givers and
  targets. Not pushed.
