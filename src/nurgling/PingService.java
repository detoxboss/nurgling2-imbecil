/**
 * Map pings shared through chat.
 *
 * <p>A ping is one map tile, addressed on the wire as the server's grid id plus the
 * tile's offset inside that grid. That pair is the only coordinate both ends agree on:
 * {@code gob.rc} is local to a session and the minimap's segment tiles are local to one
 * client's map file, while the grid id is assigned by the server and reads the same for
 * everyone.
 *
 * <p>Resolution happens on the receiving side and is shared with every other feature that
 * moves positions between players; see {@link nurgling.tools.GridLocator} for why it can
 * fail, why failure is not an error, and why it is retried.
