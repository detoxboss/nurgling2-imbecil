 * Plays "alarm/curio" when a curiosity finishes studying: a study report item removed while its
 * study meter is at the end. Curiosities taken out by hand leave with a lower meter and stay silent.
 * <p>
 * Called from NStudyInventory.cdestroy, like Ard/Hurricane's InventoryStudy.cdestroy,
 * so it also catches the curiosities the server removes right after login: they arrive finished
 * and are taken away within the same burst of messages.
