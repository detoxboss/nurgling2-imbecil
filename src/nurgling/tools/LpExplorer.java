     * all discovered the moment their names resolve. The gob is matched by resource TYPE rather
     * than exact identity, because name resolution needs a server round-trip and the player may
     * click a second harvestable gob before a delayed product (a sawn board, say) comes back -
     * productToResource() already tells us which resource the product belongs to, so the click
     * only has to confirm that *a* harvest just happened.

     * The time bound is what keeps that looseness honest. MapView only reassigns clickedGob on the
     * next map click, so a type check alone would leave the gate open indefinitely: one click on a
     * tree would credit every item name that resolved afterwards, however much later.
