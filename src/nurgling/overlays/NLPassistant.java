/**
 * Small floating icon marking a gob with undiscovered LP products - the same screen-space label
 * style NObjHarvestOl uses for its harvest icons, not a 3D ground overlay. Shows every
 * currently-undiscovered product's own icon (e.g. an apple for an undiscovered apple tree, or
 * Board/Block for a log with either still unpicked) stacked together and lightly tinted green,
 * via LpExplorer.getMarkerIcon() - falling back to a generic marker if no icon can be resolved at
 * all.
 *
 * This is a fallback only: when a gob's type has its own always-visible harvest overlay enabled
 * (see nurgling.tools.HarvestSpecs), NObjHarvestOl itself tints its own icon(s) instead (see
 * LpExplorer usage in the HarvestSpec implementations) rather than showing a second, separate
 * marker. NLPassistant only attaches when that display isn't available, i.e. when the gob type's
 * own overlay toggle is off - every resource VSpec.object tracks is covered by some HarvestSpec,
 * so "no spec at all" is not a case that arises today.
